# Intrusion-Detection-for-Internet-Of-Vehicles

The objective of our IDS is to make a novel framework for detecting the cyber attacks on IoV’s by stacking various CNN’s like VGG19,Xception, Resnet etc combined with Hyper Parameter Optimization using PSO and HPO followed by transfer and ensemble learning with using confidence averaging and concatenation.

For easily distinguishing the different cyber attack patterns like DOS or spoofing, we will be using a popular Car Hacking Dataset and perform transformation on it to convert it into digital images and apply pre-processing on it.

The dataset consists of various Intra Vehicular and External network data on which our novel model will be trained and evaluated on to detect attacks.
